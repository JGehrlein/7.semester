# 7.semester
Data analysis for the 7.semester project. Will include datasets and code for statistical analysis.
The format of all datasets is that thermotolerance data is in .csv. Code for analysis is Rmd and output files are either .pdf or .html.
The structure of the project is that all datasets are in the folder data. The code for analysis is in analysis and all output files are in the folder output.
Currently analysis for thermotolerance should be done both for flies and worms. Where the worms dataset is only from the first replicate.
If you want to use the data from repository you need to create a main folder with subfolders data, analysis and run the code from that folder as home directory in R. This is best done by including a .Rproj file in the main folder and be certain that the active project is the correct one
